## Test challenge for QA Engineer

There are 2 sections to be completed:

- [Test Strategies](#section-1-test-strategies)
- Test Automation
  - [Mobile Test design](#section-2-Mobile-test-design)
  - [REST API Test Automation](#section-3-rest-api-test-automation)

## Section 1: Test Strategies

#### Scenario

The Food Delivery services can take the order online. The delivery charge will be calculated depends on number of boxes, total price, range, vehicle type to delivery and service chages. The customer will get the discount of delivery fee for first 15 kilometers if user order food more than \$200 and more than 15 kilometers will be calculated as usual.

#### Index Formula

Delivered vehicle type will be selected by calculating with number of order.

- BIKE if Index < 40

- CAR if Index >= 40

  When

- Meal box = 1.3 per box

- Dessert box = 1 per box

**Examples**

1. Ordered 20 x Meal Boxes and 10 x Dessert Boxes

   Index = (20 \* 1.3) + 10 = 36

   Then select **'BIKE'** for delivery

2. Ordered 20 x Meal Boxes and 14 x Dessert Boxes

   Index = (20 \* 1.3) + 20 = 40

   Then select **'CAR'** for delivery

3. Ordered 15 x Meal Boxes and 20 x Dessert Boxes

   Index = (15 \* 1.3) + 20 = 39.5 then ROUNDUP to 40

   Then select **'CAR'** for delivery

#### Delivery Charge Formula

1. BIKE

   Started at \$10

   Distance between 0 - 30 Kilometers = \$7.2 / Kilometers

   Distance above 31 Kilometers = \$14 / Kilometers

   Delivery Charge will be included 10%

2) CAR

   Started at \$20

   Every distance (1 rate) = \$12 / Kilometers

   Delivery Charge will be included 10%

#### Discount

1. If customer orders + Delivery fee >= \$200

   Deliver charge will be deducted from distance between 0 - 15 kilometers

   Deliver charge above 15 kilometers will be calculated as usual

2. If customer orders + Delivery fee < \$200

   Deliver charge will be calculated as usual without discount offer

#### How logic works

**Example#1**

- Ordered 20 x Meal Boxes and 14 x Dessert Boxes
- The price of Meal boxes = \$210
- Distance from restaurant to destination = 20 kilometers

  ```
  1. Index = 20 * 1.3 = 36
  Then select BIKE to delivery (BIKE has the starter fee at $10)

  2. Distance for 0 - 30 kilometers (20 kilometers)
  Then 10 + (20 * 7.2) = $154
  Included service charged 10% = 154 * 1.10 = 169.4 ~ 170

  3. Discount if the price >= $200
  Then 10 + (15 * 7.2) = $118
  Included service charged 10% = 118 * 1.10 = 129.8 ~ 130

  Total Delivery charges = 170 - 130 = $40
  ```

**Example#2**

- Ordered 20 x Meal Boxes and 14 x Dessert Boxes
- The price of Meal and Dessert boxes = \$500
- Distance from restaurant to destination = 20 kilometers

  ```
  1. Index = (20 * 1.3) + 14 = 40
  Then select CAR to delivery (CAR has starter fee at $20)

  2. Distance = 20 kilometers
  Then 20 + (20 * 12) = $260
  Included service charged 10% = 260 * 1.10 = 286

  3. Discount if the price >= $200
  Then 20 + (15 * 12) = $200
  Included service charged 10% = 200 * 1.10 = 210

  Total Delivery charges = 286 - 210 = $76
  ```

**Example#3**

- Ordered 38 x Dessert Boxes
- The price of Meal and Dessert boxes = \$199
- Distance from restaurant to destination = 32 kilometers

  ```
  1. Index = 38
  Then select BIKE to delivery (BIKeE has starter fee at $10)

  2.1 Distance for 0 - 30 kilometers (30 kilometers)
  Then 30 * 7.2 = $216

  2.2 Distance for 31 - 32 kilometers (2 kilometers)
  Then 2 * 14 = $28

  2.3 Include started fee = 10
  Then 216 + 28 + 10 = $254

  2.4 Included service charged 10%
  Then 254 * 1.10 = 279.4 ~ 275

  3. Discount if the price >= $200
  None

  Total Delivery charges = $275
  ```

#### Mission

You are a QA who has contracts to test **Food Delivery Charge**

- [ ] Create a test plan with as much detail as possible. (Prefer Excel or google sheet format). Think of various scenarios that need testing.
- [ ] Estimation time to test your test scenaiors
- [ ] Explain how to test or technique you use to create the test scenarios in brief
- [ ] Propose the test cases from your test plan that should be covered by Automation Testing and why you selected those test cases

## Section 2: Mobile Test design

T-Wallets is a wallet to provide the alternate payment to user by using push notification payment method. User will get notify to pay the expense after the service was finished. No need to go to scan any barcode or QRcode to our trusted merchants.

QA Engineer team need to ensure the quality by designing the test plan and test cases to cover the basic functions on following mobile platform:

- iOS
- Android

Moreover we need to ensure the test cases are able to be automated in End-to-end test pipeline. We don't expect to see the test cases to be tested manually.

#### Scenario#1 Registration Flow

#### Scenario#2 Login by using PIN or Fingerprint (only Android supported fingerprint)

## Section 3: REST API test automation
1. Create a automation test scripts to get the value from this API endpoint:

    https://public-api.zipmex.net/api/v1.0/summary

2. Then write the value to log file or log to console as markdown format.

```
Zipmex market cap
| instrument | last_price | lowest_24hr | highest_24hr |
|:-----------|-----------:|------------:|-------------:|
| USD_BTC    |   56713.76 |    56575.22 |     57805.27 |
| USD_ZMT    |     1.2568 |      1.2302 |       1.2568 |
...
| USDT_GOLD  |   57.1     |           0 |            0 |
```

#### Mission
- [ ] Follow the requirement on both Web UI and API testing
- [ ] Write the automate test scripts the execution the test cases.
- [ ] Compose the README how to setup the tool and run the test automation scripts (deponds on your submittion tools). Let's say we would like to share it to anyone who doesn't have background.

ðŸ¤– **Feel free to use any language or scripts which is easy for you. ðŸ¤–

---

### Surprise us!

Ready to surprise us what you have done?

- Push the test plan and automation testing code to github repository and share us the link
- Explain how to setup the tools and how to run the test cases clearly

We are looking for your submission. We will arrange the face-to-face interview once you are passed the challenges.

**Let's rock!** ðŸ¤˜
